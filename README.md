# cargo-urn

Are you tired of writing "cargo run" wrong and getting:

``` shell
error: no such subcommand: `urn`

        Did you mean `r`?
```
<br>
Well! I've got just the thing for you! now instead of seeing that pesky error you will cremate your program alive when you spell "run" incorrectly, so be careful or you'll be left with this!

``` shell
~ $ cargo urn

You cremated your program alive.
